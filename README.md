Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

<!-- REPLACE LIST ITEMS -->
<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The flexbox flow from mobile to desktop.</li>
    <li>The use of absolute/relative positions.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The flow of cards is interrupted by a container, keeping it all one flow would be nice.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- UPDATE ENTIRE SECTION -->
<h2>The Process</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>
  <img alt="HTML5" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-red?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="CSS3" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat-square&logo=css3&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=white" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt how to effectivly use flexbox, flex-wrap and other useful flex based features to get the look I wanted.
    Clamp was my best friend in regards to typography and this resulted in a much smoother transition from mobile to desktop.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I am happy with the development of this project, however; perhaps changing the tablet card flow would be a good idea.
